## Why would storytelling be good for girls?

The premise of the 'Storytelling' teaching approach is that the way in which computing is taught may not always match the ways in which girls prefer to learn, or their interests.
When boys and girls have similar experience of programming, they show equal interest in it as an activity. However, boys are more likely to spend their time programming and therefore increase their level of experience and expertise more than girls ([Bruckman et al., 2002](https://repository.isls.org/bitstream/1/3771/1/119-127.pdf)).

Girls often have higher self-concept (or belief in their own abilities) in relation to literacy than maths or science subjects, and higher self-concept is an important factor in choosing particular subjects or careers ([Eccles et al., 1993](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1131221.pdf)). Linking computing to another subject in which they may feel more comfortable and have more experience may increase their interest and the time that they spend programming.

Previous research using storytelling approaches with primary schoolâ€“aged children has shown: 
+ Encouraging girls to program animated stories increased motivation to engage in programming and to persist with debugging when something went wrong ([Kelleher et al., 2007](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240844))
+ Using a storyboard template to plan the animation was useful to help solve problems in the code and to encourage girls to work out a solution to complete their stories ([Burke & Kafai, 2010](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1810543.1810611))
 
**Pause and reflect**
Do you notice differences in how interested female and male pupils are in computing, or how much experience they have outside of school? Have you noticed that female and male pupils use computers or computing lessons in different ways?
